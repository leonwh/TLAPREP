4.Data Structure II: Methods
Exercises 
1 Write a program that contains a method called greeting that takes a name as its parameter. It then prints a greeting message with the name included in it.  
puts "What is your first name?"
fname = gets.chomp
def say(words='fname')
  puts words + 'fname'
end
say("hi")
say("how are you")
say("I'm fine") DIDNT WORK< REWRITE SO NAME CAN BE ENTERED
TLA Solution   
def greeting(name) 
  "Hello, " + name + ". How are you doing?"   	define the method in these three lines, def method(arguments) – body - end 
end

puts greeting("bob")   call the method via string output (without puts, get nothing)
 => hello bob, how are you doing?

2 What do the following expressions evaluate to?  i.e. what does shell create from them 

1. x = 2 2

2. puts x = 2 2 nil

3. p name = "Joe" “Joe”

4. four = "four"  "four"

5. print something = "nothing" nothing => nil
 
 3 Write a program that includes a method called multiply that takes two arguments and returns the product of the two numbers.
def multiply(x, y)
(x) * (y)
end

puts multiply(56, 2) => 112   
Method name and condition (x,y = starter argument)
method body

method call using numbers of our choice

4 What will the following code print to the screen? 
def scream(words)
  words = words + "!!!!"
  return     ← testing knowledge of this key, any code after return will not be called. Usually combine with ‘if’
  puts words
end

scream("Yippeee") => no output – indicative of method call error around puts/print issue
  I think this is a scope issue, can call from inside the scope but not outside

i Edit the method in exercise 4 so that it does print words on the screen. Remove return
def scream(words)
  words = words + "!!!!"
  puts words
end

puts scream("Yippeee")
ii What does it return now?  yippeee!!!

What does the following error message tell you? ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2) from (irb):1:in `calculate_product' from (irb):4 from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0 p353/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'

I saw this when one method argument is not present/defined

e.g. def multiply vs def multiply(x,y) conditional4 COMPLETE
